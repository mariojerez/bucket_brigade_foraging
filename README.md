# Foraging using Bucket Brigade and Defense Against Parasites
I developed these programs in undergrad to simulate two foraging behaviors found among Leafcutter (Atta) ant colonies that I found interesting. I simmulated the behaviors using NetLogo, and built off of the NetLogo Ants model.

## Running the Simmulations
The simplest way to run the simmulations is through NetLogo Web.
1. Visit https://netlogoweb.org/ and click on NetLogo Web
2. Select *Choose File*
3. Upload the NetLogo file from this repository that you wish to try
4. Adjust the hyperparameters of the model using the sliders or by entering a quantity
5. Click *setup*
6. Click *go*
7. If you wish to start over with different parameter values, click *go* to pause, and repeat steps 4 through 6.

## Bucket Brigade
Some Atta foragers use a task partitioning strategy called Bucket Brigade when transporting leaf fragments from a harvest site that is far away from the nest (Hubbell 1980). In this system, a leaf fragment is cut by a large worker which is then further partitioned by other workers when it lands on the ground. Workers which specialize in transporting leaves then pick up these fragments and scurry down the trail towards the nest until they come across another ant with its jaws free. The former ant directly transfers the leaf to the latter and either returns to the harvest site or becomes the recipient of another ant, while the latter ant either carries the leaf back to the nest or passes the leaf off to another worker that it encounters. An alternative method uses indirect transfer, where ants carry leaf fragments a certain distance along the trail before dropping them and returning to collect more (Anderson 172). These dropped leaves then get picked up and transported by other ants further down the chain. This process gets repeated until one of the leaf carriers reaches the nest.
This kind of task partitioning during harvest is theorized to make the transport faster and more efficient by reinforcing the trail with more pheromones, increasing the amount of contact between ants and the food and therefore increasing exchange of information regarding the quality of food which impacts the intensity of worker recruitment (HoÌˆlldobler et al. 73-4).
